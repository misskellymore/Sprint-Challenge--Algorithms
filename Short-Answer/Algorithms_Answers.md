#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(log(n)) - As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a slightly slower rate than O(1). O(log n) is the second best solution.


b) O(n^c) - Nested loops. As the size of the input increases, the runtime used will grow quickly and is not scalable.


c) O(c^n) - As the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a much faster rate; O(c^n) is inefficient
